# EDA-on-Zomato-Datasets-for-Restaurants-in-Kolkata

**Project Objectives:** The objective of our group project was to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Zomato datasets to derive actionable insights and showcase our data analysis skills as part of our college coursework.

**Project Description:** We initiated the project by gathering and cleaning data from Kaggle, addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and duplicates. Utilizing tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, we created visualizations to explore various aspects such as rating distributions, pricing patterns, and restaurant locations. Through statistical analysis, we identified popular cuisines and analyzed average ratings by location. Additionally, we engineered features like price-to-rating ratios and review counts to enhance our analysis.

**Conclusion:** The project culminated in a comprehensive report and interactive visualizations, which highlighted our data analysis capabilities. We received positive feedback from faculty and peers for the practical insights and thorough analysis provided. The project also significantly improved our teamwork and collaboration skills, as it required effective communication and coordination among group members to achieve our objectives efficiently.
